The proposed design contains a 288-bit internal state denoted by (s1, . . . , s288).
The key stream generation consists of an iterative process which extracts the
values of 15 specific state bits and uses them both to update 3 bits of the state
and to compute 1 bit of key stream zi
. The state bits are then rotated and the
process repeats itself until the requested N â‰¤ 2
64 bits of key stream have been
generated. A complete description is given by the following simple pseudo-code:
